# Project-7
## Solution to homework assignment #7
In this assignment, tweepy endpoints are used to gauge the sentiment of 100 most recent tweets, using VADER analysis, posted by a select group of news organization.

The results that appear in this repository reflect the mood of news as of around 4PM Pacific time on Jan. 9, 2018.

Please note that in order to run the Jupyter notebook in this repository, the user will need to supply credentials needed for Twitter authentication, in a file called auth.yaml.  Please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML for details and examples.
